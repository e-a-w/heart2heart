## Intro

Heart 2 Heart is a social platform for bone marrow donors and those who have received those donations to share their stories. Our aim is to demystify the donation process and share the impact that donations have on those who need them.

This app was coded for the [Palm Beach Tech](https://palmbeachtech.org/) Hackathon 2020 to benefit [Gift of Life](https://www.giftoflife.org/), specifically to fill the need to encourage donations of bone marrow.

Specific features include:

- Users can register as bone marrow donors or recipients of a donation
- Users can share their story and update a profile, including avatar image and name
- If two users know that they have received or donated to each other, they can connect and display that connection through the app
- Site includes a FAQ and links back to the Gift of Life home page

## Tech Used

We used the MERN stack of MongoDB for a database, Node & Express for the back end and React for the front end.

We also integrated several APIs, frameworks and npm packages into our site:

- [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) for our email functionality.
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to upload and manage user images.
- [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for the front end components and design.
- [React Countdown Circle Timer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-countdown-circle-timer) for our home page feature
- To keep track of login information, we used JWT-based token authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and Passport for user authentication.
